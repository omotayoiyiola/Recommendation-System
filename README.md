# Recommendation System Prototype

## Overview

This project implements a personalized product recommendation system using machine learning. The system is built with Node.js and TensorFlow.js, leveraging user behavior data to generate recommendations.

## Features

- Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathers and preprocesses user behavior data.
- Model Development: Implements a collaborative filtering model using TensorFlow.js.
- Scalability and Performance: Utilizes Redis for caching to ensure low-latency responses.
- Evaluation and Optimization: Includes mechanisms to evaluate and optimize the recommendation engine.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:omotayoiyiola/Recommendation-System.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd recommendation-system
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-node danfojs-node redis express
   ```

4. **Ensure Redis is installed and running on your machine:**

   - **On Ubuntu:**

     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install redis-server
     sudo service redis-server start
     ```

   - **On macOS using Homebrew:**

     ```bash
     brew install redis
     brew services start redis
     ```

## Usage

1. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   node recommendation_system.js
   ```

2. **Example Output:**

   - The script will output the mean squared error (MSE) for the test data.
   - It will also provide an example of recommendations for a user.

## Evaluation

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** The script evaluates the model performance using MSE on the test dataset.
- **Recommendations:** The script demonstrates how to get recommendations for a user and outputs the results.

## Continuous Improvement Strategy

1. **A/B Testing:**

   - Implement A/B testing to compare different recommendation algorithms and determine the most effective one.

2. **User Feedback:**

   - Collect user feedback on recommendations to identify areas for improvement.
   - Use feedback to retrain the model regularly.

3. **Monitoring and Logging:**

   - Monitor the performance of the recommendation engine in real-time.
   - Log interactions and outcomes to identify trends and patterns.

4. **Regular Retraining:**
   - Regularly retrain the model with updated data to improve accuracy and adapt to changing user preferences.
